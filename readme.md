# ðŸ”© AutoInfraGPT

*by Adi Prerepa and Andrew Han*

## Overview

AutoInfraGPT was an attempt to create an LLM agent (using an [AGI architecture](https://github.com/handrew/agentic_gpt) that we built ahead of time) with the capability of creating an EC2 instance on Amazon, SSHing into it, and then running a `curl` command on the EC2 instance to a separate server.

The main logic of the code is shown below:

```python
actions = [
    Action(
        name="create_ec2_instance",
        description="Create an EC2 instance on Amazon. Returns the public ipv4 of this instance.",
        function=create_ec2_instance,
    ),
    Action(
        name="ssh_and_execute_cmd",
        description="SSH into an instance and run a command.",
        function=ssh_and_execute_cmd,
    ),
]

objective = f"""Create 1 EC2 Instance with name rat. Ssh into that instance and make HTTP request via curl to http://54.245.39.114:8080. Print the response from the server. Declare done."""

agent = AgenticGPT(
    objective, actions_available=actions, model="gpt-4"
)
agent.run()
```

where `create_ec2_instance` is a function we wrote to spin up an AWS VM and `ssh_and_execute_cmd` is another function we wrote to `SSH` into the created instance and run a UNIX command. 

The agent is instantiated with `actions` and given the objective to "Create 1 EC2 Instance with name rat. Ssh into that instance and make HTTP request via curl to http://54.245.39.114:8080. Print the response from the server. Declare done." 

The hardcoded endpoint hosts a Python server which returns a simple HTML. GPT-4 and `AgenticGPT` should, given the instructions, know to call the two functions in order, resulting in a `curl` reuquest to the given endpoint. See the output below to see the output from the agent.

## Future Possibilities

This was a trivial example that involved two steps, with calls to two functions. However, you could imagine exposing many more of AWS's APIs to `AgenticGPT`, giving it the ability to use more resources, read logs, and respond accordingly. Taken as a whole, we could conceivably see a world in which devops are automated by agents. 


## Usage

1. `git clone https://github.com/handrew/agentic_gpt`

2. Move `autoinfra_gpt.py` into the cloned folder (sorry! `AgenticGPT` is not yet on pypi)

3. Set up a `.env` file with `OPENAI_API_KEY` with your API key and `SSH_KEYFILE` with AWS SSH key.

4. `cd` into the folder and then `python autoinfra_gpt.py`. You have to have AWS credentials on your local machine.
